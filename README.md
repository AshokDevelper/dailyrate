Our Project Vision -
We have identified our purchase price and want to evaluate its competitiveness in the market. We aim to determine if the fixed amount at which the shop owner priced our product is reasonable when compared to the amounts other customers are willing to pay. We want to ensure that our purchase price aligns with market expectations and represents a fair value for the product. Please advise on how we can assess the competitiveness of our purchase price in relation to what other customers are willing to pay
